Memory Pirates is memory match game for iOS featuring the SwiftUI framework, CloudKit storage, and Game Center leaderboards. 

I originally created Memory Pirates as a practice in using UIKit constraints in 2020. In 2023, I returned to this project with the goal of converting from the UIKit framework to the newer SwiftUI framework. In the process I added Cloudkit and Game Center connectivity for data persistence and local and global leaderboards. 

## Features
- Game Center connectivity
- CloudKit data storage
- SwiftUI
- Cross platform

### Coming Soon
- New Game board sizes
- Head to Head multiplayer via local network
- iPad compatibility
- Landscape mode
